A random number is : {$rndnum}


And the integer part of that is {int($rndnum)}
And the decimal part of that is {decimal($rndnum)}

inc(3.0) is {inc(3.0)}
dec(3.0) is {dec(3.0)}


inc(3.1) is {inc(3.1)}
dec(3.1) is {dec(3.1)}

Another random number is : {random()}

Start node visited? : {visited("Start")} {visited_count("Start")}

Two thirds is : {2/3}
Which rounded to two places is {round_places(2/3, 2)}

round(3.6) is {round(3.6)}
round(3.3) is {round(3.3)}

floor(6.6) is {floor(6.6)}
ceil(6.6) is {ceil(6.6)}
