<<declare $gold_amount = 5>>
<<declare $rich = false>>
<<declare $poor = false>>

<<if $gold_amount == 5>>
    I have exactly 5 gold pieces!
<<endif>>

<<if $gold_amount > 100>>
    Wow I have a lot of gold!
<<endif>>

<<if $gold_amount < 5>>
    Wow I'm broke!
<<endif>>

<<if $gold_amount <= 5>>
    Wow I'm ALMOST broke
<<endif>>

<<if $gold_amount >= 100>>
    Wow I'm barely rich
<<endif>>

<<set $gold_amount = $gold_amount - 1>>

<<set $gold_amount = ($gold_amount * 2) / 2>>

<<set $gold_amount = $gold_amount % 1>>

After your change you have {$gold_amount}

<<if ($gold_amount < 100) && ($gold_amount > 10)>>
    I have a NORMAL amount of cash
<<endif>>

<<if not ($gold_amount > 100)>>
    I am not rich.
    <<set $rich to false>>
<<endif>>


<<if  ($gold_amount > 90) or ($gold_amount < 10)>>
    I am either rich or poor.
<<endif>>

<<if  ($gold_amount < 10)>>
    <<set $poor to true>>
<<endif>>

<<set $rich = $rich xor $poor>>

Done!
