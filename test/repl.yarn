<<declare $gender = "" as string>>
<<declare $pie_count =1 as number>>
<<declare $race_position = 5 as number>>

Choose your gender!
-> m
    <<set $gender to "m">>
-> f
    <<set $gender to "f">>
-> nb
    <<set $gender to "nb">>


I think [select value={$gender} m="he" f="she" nb="they" /] will be there!

PieMaker: I just baked [plural value={$pie_count} one="a pie" other="% pies" /], wowzer!

Runner: The race is over! I came in [ordinal value={$race_position} one="%st" two="%nd" few="%rd" other="%th" /] place!
