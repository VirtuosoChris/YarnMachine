Okay, this is the beginning of the script.
Here's another line that should happen before the save/load.
Now we're going to save in a second.
But first we'll set a variable.
<<set $variable to 666>>
The value should be {$variable}
<<save>>
We're continuing from the save point.
The variable is still {$variable}.
What would you like to do?
