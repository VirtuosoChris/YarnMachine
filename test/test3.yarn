<<declare $numberOfSidesInATriangle = 0>>
<<declare $numberOfSidesInASquare = 0>>
<<set $numberOfSidesInATriangle to 3>>

<<set $numberOfSidesInASquare to $numberOfSidesInATriangle + 1>>
The number of sides in a square is {$numberOfSidesInASquare}.
The number of sides in a triangle is {$numberOfSidesInATriangle}.

I repeat, the number of sides in a square is  {$numberOfSidesInASquare} and the number of sides in a triangle is {$numberOfSidesInATriangle}
